"I'm David Hall, President of Rock Financial."  These ads, played over and over during Pistons games, would quickly move from the bottom to the top of my list of favorite advertisments on TV if David Hall plays any role in convincing Dan Gilbert to move his headquarters downtown.  Please, Lord, let <a href="http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060317/BIZ/603170359/1001">this</a> happen!  This rumor has been floating around for a few months, but to my knowledge this is the first time that Dan Gilbert has publicly said he is indeed considering moving downtown.  <br /><br />Considering the old Statler Hotel site and the old Hudson's site, I would prefer to see them develop the Hudson's block.  Although a development this size on the Statler site would provide a legitimate anchor for Grand Circus Park, the move to the Hudson's block would really help finish off the Lower Woodward cooridor.  Detroit has plenty of pockets of development going on, but nothing that seems to be completely finished.  Quicken Loans, Compuware, Campus Martius, One Kennedy Square all within a stone's throw from eachother would create a truly walkable district and potentially fill in the remaining downtown Woodward storefronts.  <br /><br />This is really exciting, but I won't get my hopes up until I hear Quicken Loans official announcement.
