<a href="http://modeldmedia.com/">Model D</a> just launched the Pittsburgh version of their site, calling it <a href="http://www.popcitymedia.com/">Pop City</a>.  Like Detroit, Pittsburgh has to continually fight old stereotypes and tired perceptions to "break the bad news cycle."  Often beating the Free Press and News in publishing development news, Model D is exceptionally good at highlighting Detroit's transformation.  The neighborhood visiting guides are well thought out and well written and the features are always informative.  I can't imagine Pop City will be any different...Pittsburgh enthusiasts will be excited with this new website.  <br /><br />I haven't formally visited Pittsburgh, but I have driven through and as Charley in <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em> said, it really did make me "feel infinite."  Driving through the tunnel and emerging on the other side in the heart of the city was one of the cooler drives I've done.  A quick look through Pop City tells the story of very healthy city with a lot of cool neighborhoods and potential.  <br /><blockquote>Pittsburgh’s Downtown remains healthier than those of many midsize American cities. Geographically and economically central, it absorbs a 41-percent daytime population surge, the fourth-highest among U.S. metro areas; what’s more, 48 percent of Downtown workers arrive by transit – and, over lunch, it can seem as if nearly as many are bargain-hunting at Kaufmann’s landmark department store. </blockquote> Here's to a sister rustbelt, blue collar city and Pop City's success.  Pittsburgh, you give me hope for what Detroit will become.
