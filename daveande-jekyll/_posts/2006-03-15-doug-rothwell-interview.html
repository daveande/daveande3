This is a great <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060226/OPINION02/602260316/1070\">question and answer session</a> with the president of Detroit Renaissance, Doug Rothwell.  Once again, I'm happy to learn that there's a lot of talented leaders thinking about Michigan's future.  I'm excited to read his group's major recommendations to Kwame Kilpatrick, and there's a lot in his answers that suggests some good things to come.  I particularly like that he mentions the importance of building the "urban core" and talks about Detroit Synergy folks embracing Detroit for what it is.  The "edginess of Detroit and the grittiness of Detroit and the hardworking nature of Detroit" are certainly all traits that I've grown to love over the last year.  The idea of building a "brand and an image" around these is exciting and although you'd take some of that edginess away when you have have politicians and CEOs building an "image," I definitely agree that Detroit's grittiness is something worth promoting.
