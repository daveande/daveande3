<br>Amid all of the depressing news articles coming out of Detroit about the Delphi bankruptcy, I've really enjoyed Tom Walsh's two most recent columns in the Detroit Free Press. I think he's right that this state can <a href="http://www.freep.com/money/business/walsh10e_20051010.htm">learn</a> from Delphi's recovery.<br /><br />I was also happy to see that Walsh's <a href="http://www.freep.com/money/business/walsh10e_20051010.htm">second column</a> featured former University of Michigan president James Duderstadt drumming up concern for where Michigan is headed. Duderstadt came and spoke to one of my classes last term about what a university will look like in the future (<a href="http://milproj.ummu.umich.edu/home/">http://milproj.ummu.umich.edu/home/</a>). His lecture featured really innovative ideas, so I hope that he can help this state address problems that are rooted in ideas and cultures that have long been unwilling to change.
