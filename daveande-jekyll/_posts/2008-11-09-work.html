I finished the Peace Corps on July 8. Tomorrow, November 10, is my first day of work. That means I've spent a third of the year, unemployed/traveling/hanging out/enjoying no responsibilities. I'm excited and ready to start working, but the past four months "readjusting" were a lot of fun. Now if I could figure out a way to get paid while "readjusting" I will have found my "career."<br /><br />In the meantime, me a young professional.<br /><br>
