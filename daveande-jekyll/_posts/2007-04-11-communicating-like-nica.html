<br />When I was home over Christmas, I shared with my family the Nicaraguan custom to point with chin and lips (not your hand or finger) when you want to point out a location. So, for about two weeks we walked around the house puckering up our lips and laughing. With this in mind, I share with you how to communicate like a true Nicaraguan.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want someone to repeat what they said or you don’t understand</strong>: Squint or scrunch up your nose.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to say hello to someone across the street:</strong> Extend your arm parallel to the ground at waist level. Put your palm up and extend your neck so your chin points up.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to say someone is stingy or cheap:</strong> Flex your bicep and tap the bottom of your elbow with your opposite hand.<br /><br /><strong>· When you are talking about money:</strong> Extend your pointer fingers and slide one across the other as if you were peeling a carrot.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to say no: </strong>Extend your pointer finger and aggressively wag your hand back and forth.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to say someone has a lot of money:</strong> Extend your pointer finger and thumb and hold them out in front of you so that they form an invisible outline of a giant stack of money.<br /><br />· <strong>When you are talking about drinking beer or rum:</strong> Extend your thumb and pinky finger (the hang loose sign) and hold your thumb at your mouth. Move your hand up and down as if drinking from a glass.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to say something is crowded or full:</strong> Touch all fingers and thumb together on one hand.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to eat or are talking about eating:</strong> Hold your palm in front of your mouth, fingers together. Snap your fingers back and forth near your mouth.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to refer to your diarrhea:</strong> Make a fist and lock your elbow into the side of your body. Move the lower part of your arm up and down while grimacing.<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to point to something:</strong> Pucker up your lips and aim where you want to point (also works to jokingly indicate that your friend is crazy when he’s telling a dumb story).<br /><br />· <strong>When you want to get someone to come towards you:</strong> Extend your arm in front of your body and move your wrist up and down with your fingers pointed towards the ground.
