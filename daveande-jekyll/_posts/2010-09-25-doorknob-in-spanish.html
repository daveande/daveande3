I just came across this while visiting the <a href="http://pushforpeacecorps.org/">Push for Peace Corps</a> website. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2010/03/peace-corps.html">Peter Hessler's strong defense</a> of the Peace Corps, in response to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/opinion/11kristof.html?_r=1">Nicholas Kristof's March 2010 critique of the organization</a> while calling for the formation of a Teach for the World initiative, is passionate, funny, and accurate. Give it a read.<br /><br />I didn't know the word for doorknob in Spanish. There weren't any doorknobs in Palacaguina. Seriously. But if you want to know how to actually <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2007/04/communicating-like-nica.html">communicate like a Nicaraguan</a>, I'm your guy. America would be a wiser country if we had more people who had an intimate understanding of a foreign culture. And that doesn't require knowing the word for doorknob.<br /><br>
