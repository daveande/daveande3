<br>I read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/07/business/07move.html?hp&ex=1131426000&en=5aa13860fa86497a&ei=5094&partner=homepage">article</a> this morning and Tom Campion passed it along to me as well.  If I could email the couple that moved from California to Metro Detroit I'd point them to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Essential Guide to Detroit</span> that highlights eight Thai restaurants.<br /><br />I also emailed this article to my brother and Luke Emeott, both of whom live in LA.  Luke replied, "That article is pretty right on.  I don't think I'll ever own a house in this state."  I'm not sure if all native Californians could handle the cold, ominous, gray skies and piercing, souless winds of Febraury; but, Luke and Matt, this state anxiously waits for your return.
