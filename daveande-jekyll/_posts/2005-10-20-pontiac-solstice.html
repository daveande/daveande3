<br>I hope that Bob Lutz's first three cars for GM (Chevy HHR, Hummer H3, and Pontiac Solstice), all of which have gotten great reviews, are signs of what's ahead for General Motors.  I liked the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/automobiles/16AUTO.html?pagewanted=1">review</a> of the Solstice in the New York Times.  Brian Emeott and I agreed that the end was the best part:<br /><br /><blockquote>When you buy a Solstice you don't pick a color but an attitude. In Pontiac's paint scheme, red is called Aggressive, silver is Cool, gray is Sly and black is Mysterious. Then there is Envious. That is green, and it will be the color of your friends.<br /><br />INSIDE TRACK: American beauty.</blockquote>
