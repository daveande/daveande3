<br>Thanks to everyone that has posted comments so far.  I can't quite explain how fun it is to hear from people through email or through this blog, but going through a day only communicating in Spanish is tough, and when I'm able to escape to the internet to enjoy an hour in English hearing from friends and family really is cool.  Thanks.<br /><br />Also, congratulations to <a href="http://acceptableusage.blogspot.com/">Brent Carr</a> on his new job in Houston, Texas.  I hope it's not EECS related.
