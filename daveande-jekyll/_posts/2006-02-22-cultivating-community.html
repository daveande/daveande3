Anyone wandering around the Diag this week should keep an eye out for the <a href="http://cultivatingcommunity.com/index.php">Cultivating Community</a> banners advertising our benefit dinner.  My efforts making these banners, though minimal, required more of a commitment in an extracuricular activity as a non-student than I ever made in my four years as a student (excluding water polo).  That's pathetic.  <br /><br />Talk to Brent or I if you're interested in attending or learning more about the project.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/683/1682/1600/Diag%20Design.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/683/1682/320/Diag%20Design.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
