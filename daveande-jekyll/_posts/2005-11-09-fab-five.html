<br>Espn.com is running a series on the top six largest change agents in college basketball in the last 20 years.  Luke Emeott sent me this <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jackson/051011b">article</a> on how the Fab Five changed the game.  Awesome.  If you enjoy the article, check out Mitch Albom's book "Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream."  This is a must read for anyone who grew up rooting for Michigan basketball.<br /><br />Luke accurately pointed out that you'll have to plow through the part of the article that talks about the 1989 Illinois team.  The author finally notes that it was the 1989 Michigan team that took out Illinois.  Led by?  Flint's own, Glen Rice.<br /><br /><em>"Jalen Rose, the new 6-8 point guard, who sported a shaved head and a fake diamond earring, had the habit of yelling 'Money!' whenever he fired a shot."</em>
