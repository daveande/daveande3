<a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com">Crain's Detroit Business</a> just published their <a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com/files/2020s/index.html">20 people in their 20s</a> making a mark on Detroit.  It's really good stuff and makes me want to stay in this region for the next two years.  What's so exciting about these 20 people is their commitment to stay in Detroit and their willingness to create the job they want or become the catalyst to change this region.  Most exciting though and something I've thought about a lot, are the comments about Detroit as an opportunity.  Detroit offers a young person the opportunity to quickly become one of the leaders that this region so sorely lacks.  This opportunity does not exsist in Chicago or New York or any other more established city, and it's an opportunity that I look forward to taking advantage of upon my return.  In the meantime, I wish all of these 20-somethings good luck.  They are the reason I've become excited and will continue to stay excited for Detroit.
