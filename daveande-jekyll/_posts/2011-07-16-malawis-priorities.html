There are only about 8-9 countries in the world that are poorer than Malawi. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita">Its per capita GDP stands at $800 per year</a>, about how much I spent on my flat screen TV, and its total GDP in 2009 was about $4.3 billion, or <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/25/twitter-now-worth-4-billion/">about the same as Twitter's January 2011 estimated market cap</a>. So it seems a bit weird to find a billboard in Lilongwe enticing you to join the Airtel network in order to "tweet faster." If I'm the average Malawian, I think I'd be more concerned with finding my next meal and avoiding malaria and&nbsp;dysentery than with tweeting about my new mosquito net and making sure I got Lady Gaga's tweets more quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DYBWuOZ_Ufk/TiFZ_OpW0lI/AAAAAAAAAzM/qadX9BFfJ5A/s1600/IMG_0822.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DYBWuOZ_Ufk/TiFZ_OpW0lI/AAAAAAAAAzM/qadX9BFfJ5A/s320/IMG_0822.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div>
