I've spent a little bit more time than normal within Blogger over the last few days, updating the blog's design and checking out the stats that are now available. I think the stats have been included in Blogger for some time now, but I haven't taken a look until recently. Blogger now provides the number of pageviews your blog has registered over any given time period and breaks out your pageviews by specific post and/or traffic source. What did I find when looking at daveande stats? A couple of funny things.<br /><br />I nearly own the Google search term "syllabus week" coming in at number two right behind Urban Dictionary. Just this week, college students Googling "syllabus week" or some variation have registered 111 page views on <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2007/02/syllabus-week.html">my post about Nicaragua's syllabus week.</a> <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nCpfkjqZp8E/TTbaFi5RqtI/AAAAAAAAAk8/H9W_M0qPt3k/s1600/untitled.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 156px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nCpfkjqZp8E/TTbaFi5RqtI/AAAAAAAAAk8/H9W_M0qPt3k/s400/untitled.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5563874178464066258" /></a><br /><br />The daveande post with the most pageviews since May 2010 is <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2008/02/peace-corps-resume.html">Peace Corps Resume</a>. I wonder how many big hearted, adventure seeking, service oriented people have Googled "Peace Corps resume" in hopes of finding some info on how best to format a resume for the Peace Corps application only to come across my post. "Banged my head against a large concrete wall in frustration, boredom, and craziness once a month for 24 months" may have been the basis for some second thoughts and new career decisions.<br /><br>
