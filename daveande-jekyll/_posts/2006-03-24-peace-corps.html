Uh oh, it's finally arrived.  My formal <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov">Peace Corps</a> invitation marks decision time after a year's worth of pondering, questioning, and flip-flopping.  And though I'd rather just get started with my service if I decide to accept the invitation, a May 1 departure date is frighteningly close and leaves little time to waste.  So, inspired by <a href="http://d-lowe.blogspot.com/2006/03/law-school-waiting-game.html">Dan's law school post</a>, I give you a rundown on Peace Corps/Nicaragua:<br /><br />Nicaragua<br />Status: Second poorest country of the western hemisphere, distribution of income is one of the most unequal in the world.<br />Visit: Never<br />Family: None<br />Friendship: None<br />Weather: Tropical<br />Peace Corps Program: It sounds like I'd be teaching a Junior Achievement type course in local high schools and vocational institutes.<br />Language: Spanish<br />Language Knowledge: Minimal<br />Housing: Concrete or brick home with wooden doors and windows and a tin roof.  Latrine and shower in backyard.  Probably electricity and running water though both are prone to outages.<br />Intangibles: Sleeping under a mosquito net for two years, machismo, relatively "normal" food, short flight for most potential visitors<br />Prospect: Shit, I'm scared!<br /><br />There you have it.  Peace Corps/Nicaragua.  What do you think?  <br /><br />And finally, because it's never to early to start planning, I offer you possible flight options for Spring Break 2K7: Nicaragua.<br /><br />Detroit, MI to Managua, Nicaragua: $703<br />Nashville, TN to Managua, Nicaragua: $752  <br />Atlanta, GA to Managua, Nicargua: $796<br />Denver, CO to Managua, Nicaragua: $705<br />New York, NY to Managua, Nicaragua: $702<br />Phoenix, AZ to Managua, Nicaragua: $668<br />Los Angeles, CA to Managua, Nicaragua: $578<br />Boston, MA to Managua, Nicaragua: $653
