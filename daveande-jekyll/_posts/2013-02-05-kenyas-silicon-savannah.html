<a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2013/01/24/kenya-starts-construction-of-konza-technology-city/" target="_blank">Kenya has released plans to build a new city for 185,000 people 40 miles outside of Nairobi</a>. It still remains one of the world's poorest countries, but while living in Nairobi and to this day, watching from afar, I'm continually impressed with the skill and ambition of the country's business and entrepreneurial communities. The exciting forward thinking and inspiring vision of a city that this plan showcases is in stark contrast to my current city's attitude, which continues to hold on to a glorified past that is no longer (at least in the government).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2013/01/dezeen_Kenya-starts-construction-of-Konza-Technology-City_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="320" src="http://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2013/01/dezeen_Kenya-starts-construction-of-Konza-Technology-City_2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />
