I'm heading to Zambia at the end of the month to meet with the NGOs and private distributors that sell our pumps. Admittedly, I know very, very little about the country besides the name of its captial city, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusaka">Lusaka</a>, and that the northern city of Mununga, as written about in<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unheard-Memoir-Deafness-Africa/dp/0805082107/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"> Josh Swiller's Peace Corps memoir <span style="font-style:italic;">The Unheard,</span></a> is frightening. I now also know, <a href="http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/insights-from-a-honeymoon-in-zambia/">after reading about one couple's Zambian honeymoon</a>, that the country is burning, a result of climate change that is causing drought and desertification in sub-Saharan Africa.<br /><br />You won't find me on any roads at night, but during the daylight hours of my trip, I'm looking forward to learning more about the country and witnessing firsthand how our pumps are being distributed and used. I hope to return to Kenya with words other than "frightening" and "burning" to describe my visit.
