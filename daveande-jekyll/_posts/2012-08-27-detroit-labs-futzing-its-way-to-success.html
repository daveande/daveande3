This is a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3000498/how-did-detroit-labs-build-successful-business-letting-employees-screw-around">cool article discussing the growth and success of Detroit Labs</a> as well as its desire to become an innovation factory, dedicating one day a week to product development. Detroit's tech story continues to pick up steam.  <blockquote>When asked how he counters Detroit skeptics, you can hear Glomski winding up into a less-than-mild-Midwesterner riposte. “Here’s where you’ll find a company like Detroit Labs, where in a year’s time we’ve done amazing things,” he says. “We won a Gold Lion at Cannes Creativity Festival. We’ve grown a talented group of 20 developers and designers that companies like Zynga and Facebook would love to have. We make real revenue; we’re profitable. How many startups in San Francisco or New York could you say that of in their first year?”</blockquote>
