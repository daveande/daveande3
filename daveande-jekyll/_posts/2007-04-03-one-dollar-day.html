<span lang="EN-US"><br />In my research leading up to joining the Peace Corps, I read a lot about the number of people who live on one dollar or less a day (<a href="http://www.netaid.org/global_poverty/global-poverty/">1 in 6 people in the world</a>).<span style="">  </span>Reading that number from the comfort of a $720/month apartment, it was hard to even imagine how that was even possible, one dollar per day.<span style="">  </span>Though the number still shocks me, 11 months into my service I have a much better idea of what one dollar a day means.<span style="">   </span></span><span lang="EN-US"><br /><br />I get paid 3600 <i style="">cordobas</i> per month, the equivalent of $200 per month or $6.67 per day per month.<span style="">  </span>This monthly salary is certainly higher than most people within my town, yet I still manage to spend every last cord every month.<span style="">  </span>Since I’ve been keeping track of where I’ve been spending my money, I’ve found that almost a third of my salary is spent on what I define as “entertainment.”<span style="">  </span>This includes anything that I buy or do that isn’t needed, such as a night out with friends, a trip to visit another volunteer, gorging myself on McDonald’s or Burger King when I’m in Managua, going to the beach, having a beer or some rum, etc.<span style="">  </span>Now, I could make a strong case that this “entertainment” is actually an absolute necessity considering it’s the only thing that keeps me sane here, but for the sake of argument, I’ll say it’s unneeded.</span>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, if I subtract a third of my salary (3600-1200) that I spend on completely unneeded things, I’m left with 2400 <i style="">cordobas, </i>$133.33 per month or $4.44 per day per month.<span style="">  </span>At this level, I can still live very comfortably and still have a lot of unneeded expenses.<span style="">  </span>For example, I am able to rent my own house, to buy expensive gringo food like peanut butter and olive oil, to use the cyber café, to have a cell phone, and to eat meat a few times a week.<span style="">  </span>But, you can imagine that this isn’t the case when you make 2400 <i style="">cordobas</i> per month and you’re supporting a family of four or five.</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My good friend here is a teacher at the local high school, making about 2500 <i style="">cordobas </i>per month, $139 per month or $4.63 per day per month.<span style="">  </span>Her husband occasionally has part time work, but is mostly unemployed, so the family lives on and depends on my friend’s salary.<span style="">  </span>$4.63 per day per month divided by the four person family means each person lives on about $1.16 per day (<a href="http://www.netaid.org/global_poverty/global-poverty/">defined as moderate povery</a>).<span style="">  </span>They all share a bedroom, in a house with 5 other extended family members.<span style="">  </span>They eat rice, beans, and tortillas everyday with an occasional serving of meat.<span style="">  </span>Besides a few trips to neighboring cities, they rarely leave the town.<span style="">  </span>In fact, a couple of weeks ago when I asked her if she could come to a training conference two hours away, she couldn’t go because she didn’t have the 15 <i style="">cordobas </i>to pay the fare.<span style="">  </span>$0.83 cents. </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Unfortunately, the teachers, including my friend, are the lucky ones within the country.<span style="">  </span>It’s a horrible monthly wage (the lowest in <st1:place st="on">Central  America</st1:place>), yes, but it’s still a monthly wage that is almost always paid and paid on time, unlike the majority of the other work that is available.<span style="">  </span>According to the Central Bank of <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nicaragua</st1:country-region></st1:place>, 64% of the people employed are working in the informal sector performing such work as producing foods for local consumption, making handicrafts from local materials, or working as tailors, shoemakers, shoe shiners, carpenters, etc.<span style="">  </span>They are self employed, making little money month to month, and at times, making less than what’s needed for survival.<span style="">  </span>48% of the population lives below the poverty line, making <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1850.htm"><st1:country-region st="on">Nicaragua</st1:country-region> the second poorest country</a> in the western hemisphere (<st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Haiti</st1:country-region></st1:place> is number one).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So, given the money that most people are living with, my salary of $6.67 per day puts me at a level that very few in Nicaragua reach.  Tack on to my salary the health benefits I have through Peace Corps and an American credit card, and I'm one of the most fortunate persons in my town, despite living at a level that is lower than any I've experienced in my life.  And though I now have a better idea of what one dollar a day means and I can see everyday the people living at that level, I'm convinced I could not do it.  Whether I'm sitting in a $720/month apartment in Ann Arbor or a  $27/month house in Nicaragua, one dollar a day is not right.<br /></span></p>
