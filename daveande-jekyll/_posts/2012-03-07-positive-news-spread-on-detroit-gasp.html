<div class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.inc.com/innovation-hot-spots-detroit">Inc. magazine has a great spread of articles on Detroit</a></span><span class="s2"> and what is happening here within the startup community. I like the attitude of those featured in the articles as well as the attitude I've experienced throughout the region over the last month. We're here, we're not apologizing for anything, we have a very unique and exciting opportunity, we're confident we're creating something great. But they say this much better in the articles. Read up, come visit, get involved.</span><br /><span class="s2"><br /></span><br /><span class="s2">--------------------------------</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s2"></span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s2">"It's not 'What are we going to do?'" Tatoris says. "It's 'wow, I can't wait to see what Detroit is like in five years."&nbsp;For the folks who have seen Detroit rise and fall over the decades, the view from Webward Avenue is one a city on the move once again.&nbsp;"I just don't know where the tail end of that is going to be," Smith says. "But I'm going to like the ride."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></blockquote>---------------------------------<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s2">"I'm going to be telling my grandkids about this five-year stretch when Detroit got back its mojo."</span></blockquote>---------------------------------<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s2">Something Bigger:&nbsp;It's rare to be in the right place at the right time, but when you are, the sparks just seem to ignite out of thin air. At this moment, Detroit seems to be "right," as it's experiencing a truly fresh start through revitalization. It's not just an up-and-coming downtown center that's drawing talent; it's the chance to help change the landscape of a region that is in dire need of it and the opportunity to make a long-lasting impact.</span></blockquote>---------------------------------<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s2">&nbsp;"When there are doubters, you work a little harder," says Jake Cohen, Detroit Venture Partners' Vice President. "Just the other day, I was on the phone with someone from Sequoia Capital and he was telling me which industries were attracting money on the West Coast--like somehow I wouldn't already know. I think a lot of us have a chip on our shoulder here. People think that our start-ups aren't real, and that we don't know what it's like anywhere else--they think we just got stuck here. But there are a lot of people here who could be anywhere else. It's a choice."</span></blockquote>----------------------------------<br /><br /><div class="p2"><span class="s2"></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20111208/NEWS06/112080686/Snyder-tells-young-people-Forget-Chicago-be-part-of-changing-Detroit">And though this isn't from any of the articles</a></span><span class="s2">, it's one of my favorites and seems appropriate for this post (feel free to substitute Chicago with your city).</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s2"></span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s2">"Do you want to be another yuppie in Chicago, or do you want to make a difference in Detroit?" - Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder</span></blockquote>
