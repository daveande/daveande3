<br>I got home today just in time to turn on the TV and watch the bottom of the ninth inning of the Tigers vs. Athletics game.  <a href="http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061014/NEWS99/310140003">This is just too good to be true</a>.  My host family was a little weirded out to see me jumping in the hair, yelling "Walk off home run, walk off home run!!!!!" but they can think what they want...the Detroit Tigers are in the World Series!  <br />  <br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/683/1682/1600/mlb_a_detroit2_412.0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/683/1682/320/mlb_a_detroit2_412.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
