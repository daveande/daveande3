<br>After two years I still plan meetings knowing that I'll be the only one to show up. I convince myself that it'll be different this time. I cancel weekend trips, I leave friends' houses early, I Inconvenience myself to plan an agenda, to show up on time, to wait an extra fifteen minutes after waiting for thirty. You think I'd learn, but I haven't. No one shows up and I take another punch in the face. I lose. Nicaragua wins.  <br /><br /><a href="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd215/dovetr/Cheerleader.gif">In this video</a>, I'm the cheerleader and Nicaragua is the basketball.<br /><a href="http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5858/blondemomenttc4.gif">In this video</a>, I'm the unsuspecting spectator and Nicaragua is the sprinter.<br /><a href="http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa289/aggiekj/Gifs/crankyronaldcc8.gif">In this video</a>, I'm the McDonald's customer and Nicaragua is Ronald McDonald.<br /><br />Nicaragua-1,000,103 vs. David-2
