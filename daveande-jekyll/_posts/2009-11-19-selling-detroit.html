Check out Time's <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/specials/assignment_detroit/">Assignment Detroit's</a> Selling Detroit <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/storysupplement/fortune_poll/index.html">project</a>. Pretty cool idea, although I found most of the ads fairly underwhelming. I like Kid Rock's endless ambassadorship for his city but something tells me he's not really the one to attract a bunch of young creative types. <br /><br>
