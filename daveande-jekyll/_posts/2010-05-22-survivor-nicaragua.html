Nicaragua was <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/nicaragua-to-host-two-seasons-of-hit-tv-series-survivor-151517.php">just selected as the host country</a> for the 21st season of Survivor. The host, Jeff Probst, described the country as the land of â€œimpenetrable terrain, smoking volcanoes and savage wildlife." That's pretty accurate when describing all of Nicaragua, but maybe a little over the top for the show. They're filming in one of the nicest areas of the country. <br /><br />Should be interesting to see if <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2010/04/land-trailer.html">Land</a>, the documentary film about San Juan del Sur's quick development, gets any more buzz because of the show. <br /><br>
