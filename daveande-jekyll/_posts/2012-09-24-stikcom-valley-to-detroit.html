The Detroit tech movement continues to pick up significant steam, with the lastest news <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/detroit/2012/09/18/stik-com-relocates-from-san-francisco-to-downtown-detroit/">being the relocation of </a><a href="http://www.stik.com/">Stik.com</a> from San Francisco to Detroit. Stik, which allows users to provide and seek business referrals via Facebook, was started by two Michiganders (one of whom was a friend of Brian Emeott's at Harvard!) and will be moving into the Madison building, bringing six employees and plans to hire more.<br /><br />&nbsp;I'm excited to have them in town. I had a chance to go to lunch last week with one of the founders, Nathan, and enjoyed hearing about their business as well as the thought that went into the decision to move to Detroit. From what I gathered, moving their company to Detroit wasn't simply a "I want to move back to my home state" decision, though that obviously played a role. Detroit indeed offered significant advantages over the hectic pace of San Francisco, particularly in finding and holding onto talent, and that advantage (especially if it bears fruit for Stik.com) bodes well for Detroit's startup community. Welcome to Detroit, Stik!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.stik.com/">Check out their site to gather referrals from your friends</a> for just about any professional service: Doctors, real estate agents, insurance agents, financial planners. And be sure to keep an eye on them as they grow their business in Detroit!
