Why do we still have to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/business/economy/10leonhardt.html?hp">articles </a>that state "The real problem is that many people don’t want to buy the cars that Detroit makes" when last year GM sold more cars and trucks worldwide than any other car maker? They managed to do this with less workers than Toyota, Nissan, and Volkswagen. GM's Cheverolet Malibu was named the 2008 North American Car of the Year, beating out the Honda Accord (and it has better fuel economy than the Accord!),  and GM's Saturn Aura and Chevy Silverado were named 2007 North American Car and Truck of the Year, beating out the Toyota Camry and Honda Fit.<br /><br />Why is Thomas Friedman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/opinion/10friedman.html">saying</a> "If we miss the chance to win the race for Car 2.0 because we keep mindlessly bailing out Car 1.0, there will be no one to blame more than Detroit’s new shareholders: we the taxpayers," when Detroit, and specifically GM, will release <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/electriccar/">Car 2.0</a> in November 2010? Why is he willing to tout Japan's "government led electric car project" and yet spit on any effort of the American government to invest in a company developing an electric car that will destroy the fuel economy of a Toyota Prius? <br /><br />Why, if the domestic auto industry problems are all self created, would a relative start up in Silicon Valley also be <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200881210018">asking for government money</a> to continue to develop the automotive technologies of tomorrow?<br /><br />Why are we not talking about the <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/electriccar/">Chevrolet Volt</a> and what our nation needs to do to get it on the road today? Why are we willing to watch GM fail when the company holds our nation's best chance at lowering our oil consumption?<br /><br />Why is no one reporting that our <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008112120001">nation's highest paid autoworkers</a> work at Toyota's Georgetown, KY and Fremont, CA plants?<br /><br /><blockquote>In the follow-up memo, Toyota pointed out that workers at Georgetown and at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. in Fremont, Calif., which Toyota owns with GM, are the highest-paid autoworkers in the United States.<br /></blockquote><br />Why didn't anyone remind Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Richard Shelby of Alabama that all of their states have <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/266.html">always received more federal funding than they've paid in federal taxes</a>? Before they killed the auto deal, why didn't anyone remind these senators that much of the excess federal money their states receive comes from the workers in the states they've turned their back on?<br /><br />Why can the American government quickly pass a bill that shells out $700 billion to financial institutions, but can't, over the course of a month, come up with a bill that releases $14 billion to the auto industry?<br /><br />Why?<br /><br>
