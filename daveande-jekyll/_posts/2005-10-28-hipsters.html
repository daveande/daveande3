<br>I thought the short blurb about the Garden Bowl Bar in the Essential Guide to Detroit was really funny.<br /><br /><blockquote>You're probably so sick and tired of the word "hipster" by now that you're ready to wring someone's neck.  Well, put on the fingerprint-proof gloves and wring away because the Garden Bowl Bar has more hipsters than a Strokes/Franz Ferdinand double bill held in a thrift store on New York's Lower East Side.  Hipster bartenders, hipster DJs, hipster bowlers, hipster hair-dos, hipster bands playing free shows.  All your favorite MySpacers will be there!</blockquote>
