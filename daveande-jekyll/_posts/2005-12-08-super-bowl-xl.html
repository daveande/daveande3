<br>As the Super Bowl gets closer, more articles are appearing in the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News talking about the preparations.  What's been done, what still has to be done, and what won't be finished.  This <a href="http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2005512080523">article</a> was in the Free Press today, talking about the committee reaching out to the media to cast Detroit in the most positive light. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like it'll work much, but I like to hear that they are at least being proactive in developing the media's positive perceptions. <br /><br />So far, all of the articles I've read say that people have been very impressed with the host committee and the committee's preparations.  They seem to be a competent, talented group that's done a really good job to date.  I wish they were in charge of the city rather than the Super Bowl.  Detroit could use some competent, talented people in city hall.
