<br>I typed out a fairly long review of my first two and half weeks in Nicaragua this afternoon only to have the computer bring up an error message when I tried to upload.  Needless to say, I lost the entire post...welcome to the third world.<br /><br />To summarize, I made it to Nicaragua on May 3 with 16 other trainees.  Our first three days were spent in a really nice resort type hotel in Managua before we were sent to our host towns and families.  Each town has three to four trainees, grouped together based on language ability.  My group tested into the novice mid category which essentially means that we speak in isolated words, grunts, and phrases that only the most sympathetic ear can understand.  The first weekend with my family was a lot of me saying ¨Si¨ to things that I didn´t understand.<br /><br />I live in Niquinohomo with my host mom, 7 year old sister, 19 year old brother, and 26 year old brother.  Our house is fairly nice...it´s a U shaped house with a small courtyard type middle.  We normally have electricity, and we have a flushing toilet, but we rarely have running water.  <br /><br />My days are busy and tiring.  I normally wake up at 7am (although I rarely sleep through the night because of roosters, dogs, busses, etc.  There´s an absurd amount of noise)  I eat breakfast with my mom and sister, then I have language classes Monday through Thursday.  Wednesday afternoons, Fridays, and Saturday mornings are spent taking technical classes with the other 16 trainees.  We travel to various towns around Masaya where current volunteers teach us about teaching, Nicaragua, security, etc.  Fridays are also the days that we´ve been receiving our vaccacinations...7 and counting, so far.  After classes I eat dinner with my family and do whatever homework I have before retiring to my room around 9 or 10.  I go to bed with my mind swimming in Spanish and English.<br /><br />My Spanish is improving, I suppose, but it´s an uphill battle.  You lose your personality when you can´t talk...it´s one of the more frustrating experiences I´ve had.  I´m severely jealous of the trainees that came down essentially fluent.  I´d give anything.  So much patience is needed.<br /><br />My town is fairly small, and although there´s an internet cafe, the connection is not always great and it´s rather expensive for our Peace Corps allowance.  Now that I´m getting to know some other towns and the bus system, I hope to be able to update a little more...no promises though.<br /><br />Things I want: a giant burrito from BTB (what´s the new name?), a budweiser, a wallow spot on the hoover couch,  a tv to watch game 7 of pistons vs. cavs
