<br>I caught this quote in an article tracking the exit polls for the mayoral race.  It says it all.    <br /><br /><blockquote>"I love my neighborhood. I'm really going to miss our house if we move," Laura Machlay said. "It feels like the city moves three steps forward, four sideways and two back. I don't understand, other cities face hard times and they come back. Other cities move forward and we're kind of not."</blockquote>
