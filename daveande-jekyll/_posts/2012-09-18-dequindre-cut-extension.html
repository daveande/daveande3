<a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2012/09/dequinder_cut_extension_past_e.html">Good news for the Dequindre Cut</a> - a plan to extend the pathway through Eastern Market and onto Midtown and Hamtramck will move forward in the City Council and has a $10 million federal grant to help pay for the costs. I don't known anything about real estate development but something tells me that a complex plan like this would have been already executed upon in a more progressive city. Nonetheless, if this plan comes to fruition the cut will be one of the coolest parts of the city.  </br> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bvshXK8gPLY/UFh7mP07d0I/AAAAAAAABSg/ljD1-x-TuFs/s1600/11215558-standard.jpeg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="266" width="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bvshXK8gPLY/UFh7mP07d0I/AAAAAAAABSg/ljD1-x-TuFs/s400/11215558-standard.jpeg" /></a></div> </br>Photo credit: <a href="http://photos.mlive.com/detroit/2012/06/dequindre_cut_walking_and_bike_5.html">http://photos.mlive.com/detroit/2012/06/dequindre_cut_walking_and_bike_5.html</a>
