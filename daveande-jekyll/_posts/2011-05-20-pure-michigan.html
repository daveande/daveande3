I like this one a lot and really like seeing the Faygo factory.<br /><br /><iframe width="530" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dXg1jQuqp6w?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />The newest Michigan business ads now featuring the Pure Michigan theme. I like them but think the feel of these ads have a much better fit for tourist marketing. And why do so many business type commercials, especially those trumpeting universities, have a shot with a glass "whiteboard" with someone writing a bunch of chemistry crap on it while eager eyed dorks look on from a conference table? That's not inspiring at all. I've never even seen one of those glass whiteboards (and I studied engineering with those dorks at the conference table!).<br /><br /><iframe width="530" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cWyZ1BnXYLg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />And because you just can't get enough.<br /><br /><iframe width="530" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SKL254Y_jtc?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
