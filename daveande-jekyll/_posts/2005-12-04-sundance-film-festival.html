<br>My brother told me about this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/movies/MoviesFeatures/04clar.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1133749221-eZAGxzLAxEUu3Js6Bz45Pg">article</a> on the programming department of the Sundance Film Festival.  His boss is John Cooper, the director of programming who's featured in the article, and Matt is one of the people that help screen the films that come in.  Sounds like a cool job, huh?
