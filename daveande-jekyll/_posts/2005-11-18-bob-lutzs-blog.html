<br>Bob Lutz took a lot of initial heat before the Chevy HHR hit dealerships.  Because it was one of the first cars that he was behind from the beginning of its development, he defended it aggressively.  And, so far, he's been right as the HHR has done well according to most reports.  Lutz's latest <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2005/11/hhr_fit_to_be_t.html#more">blog entry</a> talks about the early successes of the HHR.  <br /><br />And he says "tricked out" which I found quite funny coming from <a href="http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/money/graphics/2005/03/26/cngm26.jpg">this guy</a>.  Pimp my ride, Bob!
