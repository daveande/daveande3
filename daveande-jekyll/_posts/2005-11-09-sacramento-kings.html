<br>I can't believe that an NBA team would play footage of "<a href="http://www.freep.com/sports/pistons/pistonss9e_20051109.htm">burned out cars, abandoned buildings and empty streets</a>" as they introduced the Detroit Pistons.  Classless, inappropriate, and wrong.  I'm glad the Pistons ended up beating the pants off the Kings.  As Luke Emeott pointed out, "this shit wouldn't have flown if CWebb was still there."
