As most of you know, I spent the majority of the year in Kenya working for <a href="http://kickstart.org/" target="_blank">KickStart International.</a> My project was related to the foot powered irrigation pumps we sell throughout Africa, and I spent more than a month in Zambia and <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/search/label/Malawi" target="_blank">Malawi getting a first hand look</a> at how our <a href="http://www.kickstart.org/products/super-moneymaker/" target="_blank">MoneyMaker pumps</a> are used and the impact they are making on the lives of African farmers and their families.<br /><br />There are plenty of positive statistics I could share as a result of our Malawi/Zambia survey where we interviewed over 500 farmers using our pumps, but I'd rather share one simple quote we captured while interviewing Dancen Kazimbi, a Malawian farmer using our MoneyMaker pump:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I'm planning on getting more land because what I currently have is not enough. With the MoneyMaker, anything is possible.</blockquote>Anything is possible. Beyond providing extra income that helps feed their families, pay for their children's education, and improve their living situations, the MoneyMaker pump allows farmers and their families to think about the future. For the first time in their lives, these farmers can look past today's concerns. They no longer have to worry about what their family will eat today and how they'll pay for their daughter's school fees this semester. They can finally look to and plan for the future with a sense of dignity that everyone deserves and yet so few in the developing world experience. They can finally look to the future and dream. Anything is possible.<br /><br />This past week, I got an email from my former boss asking me to pass along to anyone who might be interested in KickStart's annual appeal for donations. I didn't have a chance to meet Mama Edna, the farmer featured in KickStart's email (below), but I met plenty of farmers just like her and know first hand that KickStart's work makes sense. The organization has the tools, the passion, the talent, and the model to rapidly scale this solution to reach the millions of African farmers that are in need. These farmers don't want a handout, they want a way to make money and a means by which they can plan for the their and their family's futures. KickStart provides just that and you should help them achieve this by donating.<br /><div><br /></div><div>If you're interested in donating visit <a href="http://kickstart.org/donate/" target="_blank">KickStart's donate page</a>. And feel free to send me any questions about &nbsp;the organization, their work, or my specific project. Would love to help.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Meet Mama Edna</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--crZnrn2zlc/TuOxjU3FQVI/AAAAAAAAA2c/EznN_FgXSFs/s1600/Edna_Small.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="255" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--crZnrn2zlc/TuOxjU3FQVI/AAAAAAAAA2c/EznN_FgXSFs/s320/Edna_Small.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />Mama Edna sells her fruits and vegetables from a kiosk in Sotik town, 125 miles from Nairobi. She says that buying a MoneyMaker pump changed everything for her family in a very short time – she proudly describes herself as a prosperous, serious farmer with a hired farmhand.<br /><br />The year before, Edna was dependent on rainfall and a bucket for irrigation. Her crops often failed in the drought. Even when she could bring something to market, everyone else was selling the same produce and much of her harvest went to waste because there was little demand.<br /><br />Mama Edna knew about the MoneyMaker pump but didn’t think she could buy it outright because she had to pay school fees for three children. She bought her pump with KickStart’s unique mobile phone layaway program “Tone kwa Tone” or “Drop by Drop.” Edna’s farmhand generates even more income from the pump with a car wash business next to the river.<br /><br />The first thing Mama Edna says when asked about her pump is, “Kama siyo hii ningekwama” or “If it weren’t for this, I’d be stuck.” She sees a future where she will be a model farmer who supplies her produce to rural schools and hospitals. She says, “I am now the envy of the village, thanks to this amazing pump!”<br /><br />KickStart uses your funds to build awareness of the value of pump ownership through radio advertising, Farmer Field Days and other events. KickStart also tracks the impact of pump ownership to measure nutrition, education, electrification, and other lifestyle improvements.<br /><br />Your funds help Mama Edna and hundreds of thousands of farmers like her provide better nutrition, better education and a better future for their families, as well as provide additional jobs for dealers, distributors and farmhands.  </div>
