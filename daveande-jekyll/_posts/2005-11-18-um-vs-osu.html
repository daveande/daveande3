<br>I enjoyed <a href="http://www.detnews.com/2005/um/0511/18/A01-386462.htm">this column</a> in the Detroit News.  I can't wait for the game.<br /><br /><blockquote>Remember, this whole Michigan-Ohio battle started way back in 1835 when the states actually fought over Toledo, true story. Ohio won but took Toledo anyhow. In exchange, Michigan got the Upper Peninsula, Charles Woodson, Desmond Howard and four free passes to Cedar Point.</blockquote>
