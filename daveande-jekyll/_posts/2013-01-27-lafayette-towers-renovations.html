My Detroit home has a new owner. I've seen a few articles since Gregory Jackson purchased the towers and they all seem to say the right things - <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130122/BIZ/301220341/Detroit-developers-revamp-high-rises-young-professionals?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE" target="_blank">he's planning on renovating and improving the units and the entire complex</a>. $5 million, as my friend Ryan pointed out, seems like a pretty low amount based on how my kitchen and bathroom look (1960s), and that doesn't even touch the heating/cooling issues, the hallways, nor the state of the parking lot. But, $5 million is $5 million, and it's likely more money than has been invested in the property in many years. <a href="http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/miesbookreview1012.aspx?iframe=true&amp;width=90%25&amp;height=90%25" target="_blank">Mr. Mies can't complain with that</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mooGy1CYq0w/UQXFQPuFnKI/AAAAAAAACLM/m5Gy2mvI7eY/s1600/IMG_20121006_150910.jpg" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="294" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mooGy1CYq0w/UQXFQPuFnKI/AAAAAAAACLM/m5Gy2mvI7eY/s320/IMG_20121006_150910.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />
