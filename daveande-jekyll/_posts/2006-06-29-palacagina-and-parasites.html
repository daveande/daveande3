<br>We've been really busy the last few weeks, so I haven't had the time to update.  But, a lot has happened and we're almost done with our training period, which is exciting and frightening.<br /><br />My training group finished our youth group project a couple of weeks ago when we spent three days working with our group and students from two local schools cleaning the main street of Niquinohomo.  The street really did look a lot nicer when we were finished, but it was completely trashed again within two days.  That was a little discouraging, but without trash service or waste baskets within our town it's hard to fight.  Anyway, it's been a lot of fun working with our youth group as most of them are around my age.  It's also helped my spanish along. <br /><br />Our second class at the school was two weeks ago.  I taught to the same class which made it quite a bit easier than the first time.  My second class was definitely a lot better than my first.  My Spanish was a bit better and I was more prepared for the environment.  <br /><br />We also had our second language interview.  Basically, you talk with one of the language professors for 10 or so minutes.  The conversation is recorded so that when the interview ends two people are able to listen and critique your Spanish ability.  My first interview wasn't much of a conversation.  It was more me blurting words (and by words, I mean colors) and the two or three phrases that I knew.  Needless to say, my second interview was much better.  I was graded at the intermidiate level which means I can carry on a simple conversation and "get by."  I certainly don't feel all that comfortable with the language, but it has gotten a lot better since I arrived, and the interview helped remind me how much I have improved, even if I have a long way to go.<br /><br />In other news, this past weekend I woke up on Saturday morning running to the bathroom.  I then spent the morning in the bathroom and the rest of the day in bed without energy and with a fever.  Sunday, I woke up feeling alright and Monday I was back to normal for the most part, but I learned on Tuesday that I have a bacterial infection and two types of parasites.  Pleasant, I know.  Truthfully, I feel fine now...it sounds a lot worse than it is.  Anyway, I took some pills last night to kill the parasite and for the next three days I have antiboitics to take.  The worse part is that it has made me a lot more conscious of what I'm eating and how it's prepared.  This makes it a lot harder to eat anywhere in Nicaragua.  I haven't had much of an appetite lately, but slowly it's returning.  <br /><br />And...we finally received our sites.  For the next two years I'll be living in Palacag端ina.  We got a list of possible sites two weeks ago and then we had an interview with our boss to explain our preferences.  We had to wait a week before finding out which made for some good speculation amongst the trainees.  It was a little unnerving the night before knowing that someone else was deciding where you'd live for two years, but I didn't have much of a preference in sites.  Beyond Niquinohomo and a few other towns, I really don't know much about other cities and regions of Nicaragua, so it was hard to decide where I wanted to move based on a short paragraph description.  Palacag端ina sounds good to me.<br /><br />The town is in the north of Nicaragua, in the department of Madriz.  The entire town has around 16,000 people with 3,500-4,000 people within the main city and the rest in the surrounding rural areas.  It's the first time that a business volunteer will live there, but there's been a number of health and environment volunteers, and I'll have a sitemate from the health sector.  I'll teach in the city school and also in a small rural school outside of the town, and apparently there's several other NGO's that work within the city. <br /><br />On Monday I leave for a week to visit Palacag端ina, giving me a nice chance to get to konw it a bit more before moving there for good.  The following week we return to our training towns for our final week of Spanish and technical classes before spending our final week in Managua before swearing in as volunteers and moving onto our sites.  The last few weeks are really busy with finishing everything up before training ends.  <br /><br />Other thoughts: How are the Tigers so good and why do I have to miss this season?  I can't wait to move back to <a href="http://modeldmedia.com/features/transform50.aspx">this</a>.  I'm jealous of all that went to Bonaroo.  Why isn't anyone going to Nashville for the 4th of July?
