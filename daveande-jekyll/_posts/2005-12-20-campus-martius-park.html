<br>Campus Martius Park was just ranked as the <a href="http://www.pps.org/info/newsletter/december2005/us_canada_squares">4th best public square </a>in the US and Canada.  And it's only been open for a year!  They also have this <a href="http://www.pps.org/info/newsletter/december2005/motor_city">great article</a> on the park.  I would definitely agree that one of the "key successes" of Campus Martius, and why I enjoy just sitting down there and watching the activity, is the diversity of the visitors.  People from the suburbs to people living on Detroit's streets, everyone just hangs out and enjoys the city.  It'll only get more popular in the coming months with the Super Bowl and Winter Blast attracting people downtown and One Kennedy Square building opening in the spring.
