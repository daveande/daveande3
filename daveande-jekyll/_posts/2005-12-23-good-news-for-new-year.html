<br>Three articles today in the Detroit News were a welcome change of pace from the mostly bad news that this state has generated over the past year.  <br /><br />1) I like that the newly appointed head of the Michigan Economic Development Corp. has the <a href="http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051223/OPINION03/512230361/1148">experience of watching</a> a once dominant company/industry buckle and eventually collapse under pressure from competitive forces.  The Michigan auto industry might not completely collapse, but I think that it's safe to say that it won't be what we know today.  I hope that Epolito is right when he says that the "economic revival" is beginning.  A good start...business tax reform, 21st century jobs fund, and education reform.<br /><br />2) It looks like Kwame Kilpatrick is really reaching out to area leaders to address a lot of the problems that plague Detroit.  <a href="http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051223/METRO/512230352">This isn't</a> the first article I've read since the election that has praised Kilpatrick with bringing in outside help and mending fences.  Let's hope that this collaborative appoarch of the Kilpatrick administration continues.  It's also good to know that the election talks of Detroit falling into receivership sometime in December seem to have been exaggerated. <br /><br />3)  The more I <a href="http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051223/BIZ/512230356/1022">read</a> about Jennifer Granholm, the happier I am that she's our governor during this time.  I think that she has a really good grasp on what needs to be done in Michigan to adapt to globalization and eventually prosper from it.  I hope that people in Michigan understand that she's right when she says, "It wouldn't have mattered who was sitting in this chair.  The voters of Michigan are not stupid. They know globalization and outsourcing of jobs is not something a governor is going to stop."  <br /><br />These three articles really helped put me more at ease with Michigan's leadership.  And if everything still goes to shit the next two years, at least we still have Chauncy Billups, Rip Hamilton, Ben Wallace, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, George Blaha, and Mason.  Ball don't lie!
