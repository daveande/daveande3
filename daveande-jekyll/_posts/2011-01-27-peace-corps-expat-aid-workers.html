These gems were just passed along to me by two different friends. The first one needs no comment.<br /><br /><object width="500" height="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1-wDq17zyN0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1-wDq17zyN0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="500" height="400"></embed></object><br /><br />The second is a blog similar to <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/">Stuff White People Like</a> but it's focused on expat aid workers. I found myself laughing and cringing, sometimes at the same time, while reading through. I've been guilty of a lot of it. Take, for example, the start of <a href="http://stuffexpataidworkerslike.com/2010/12/13/4-drivers/">number four on Drivers</a> which is eerily close to <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2011/01/trip-over.html">my description of arriving in Nairobi</a>:<blockquote>Upon arriving at the airport in a new country after a long flight, followed by the entanglement that is immigration, luggage retrieval, and customs, you stumble sweaty and bleary-eyed into the arrival pen. You scan the sea of unfamiliar faces, desperately hoping to see a sheet of A4 with your name on it. There it is! You make eye contact, nod and smile. And as you hand your whole being over to that other human, you can relax: You’re with the driver now.</blockquote>I also liked number 14 on hot showers (the shower head in my bathroom is a "suicide shower") and this tidbit from <a href="http://stuffexpataidworkerslike.com/2011/01/06/12-establishing-field-cred/">Establishing Field Cred</a>:<blockquote>You can also drop hints that you’ve got field cred by always pronouncing the names of cities and countries the way a local would (eg., Nee-ka-ra-wa instead of Nik-uh-rah-gwa).</blockquote>In the Peace Corps, I had a pretty good idea of whether or not I'd like you based on how you pronounced Nicaragua. Trying to establish field cred, in this case, wasn't going to get you very far.<br /><br />Note: I've learned in my few short weeks in Nairobi that serving in the Peace Corps immediately gives you a deep reservoir of field cred in the eyes of non PC expat aid workers.
