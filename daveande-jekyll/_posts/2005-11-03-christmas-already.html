<br>On Tuesday morning I woke up to my alarm playing Christmas carols.  I was still out of it when I turned off my alarm, and I don't think it really registered until later that night when I was setting my alarm when I heard that same station still playing Christmas carols.  Then it dawned on me that it was November 1, and that the radio station must have decided to skip Thanksgiving, jumping into the holiday season almost two months in advance.  I thought this was absurd.  I thought the Christmas season started the day after Thanksgiving, not the first day of November.
