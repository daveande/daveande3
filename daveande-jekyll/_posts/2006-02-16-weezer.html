Rivers Cuomo is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/garden/16weezer.html">strange bird</a>.  I hope he's listening to Puccini now, writing something even remotely close to as good as Pinkerton.  <br /><br />I'm not sure what's stranger to me...thinking about the lead singer of Weezer living underneath a freeway in Culver City, CA in a black apartment with the windows covered with fiberglass insulation, or realizing that the Blue Album came out 12 years ago when I was 11 years old.
