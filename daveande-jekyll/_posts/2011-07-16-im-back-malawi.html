<div class="MsoNormal">I was scheduled to arrive in Lilongwe, Malawi on Monday afternoon, but due to some prior flight’s problems, they ended up rebooking me onto a flight for Tuesday and put me up in <a href="http://www.sarovahotels.com/stanley/index.php?page=distinguished">Nairobi’s Stanley Hotel</a>. Yeah, I could have just as easily stayed at my apartment for the night, but why go back to an apartment with no food, when I was offered three free meals and a room at Nairobi’s most historical hotel, where men in top hats fetch your bags and Ernest Hemingway used to rest his head? Don’t mind if I do hole up for the day here:</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3OpmRESg8cA/TiFVqOFfMEI/AAAAAAAAAzE/uPz8w8GGbX0/s1600/IMG_0803.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3OpmRESg8cA/TiFVqOFfMEI/AAAAAAAAAzE/uPz8w8GGbX0/s320/IMG_0803.JPG" width="320" /></a></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Especially when what I was escaping is as chaotic as the street right below my hotel room:</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PqoB5cKh_hI/TiFUQGlkH6I/AAAAAAAAAy8/zUlDtDbB58I/s1600/IMG_0802.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PqoB5cKh_hI/TiFUQGlkH6I/AAAAAAAAAy8/zUlDtDbB58I/s320/IMG_0802.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The luxury was short-lived, however. I was back into the thick of that chaos by 6am Tuesday morning, fighting through airport security and check-in lines before finally boarding my flight to Lilongwe. It was a long trip, touching down in Lusaka for one hour and arriving in Lilongwe in the late afternoon. Lilongwe, with its relatively empty streets and small town feel was a welcome change of pace to Nairobi, and I actually felt pretty good (maybe arrogant?) getting into the city center – like I had come a long way since the last time I was here and am no longer just some amateur. I now know what I’m doing, how to navigate the country, who I need to work with, how much I should be spending. I’ve got the phone numbers of taxi drivers in both major cities and know exactly where to stay. I even know how to drive a hard bargain – cash is king here and USD is God...my offer for $60/night paid in USD cash was accepted at a hotel with $85/night rooms!</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">I’ll be here for the next two weeks. Whereas the last visit to Malawi was about research and learning, this visit is all about implementing and should be a lot of fun, even if all that has to be done is a bit daunting. I’ll be interviewing and hiring for two data collectors, setting up field work for the data collectors so that they can interview close to 400 farmers using our pumps, and starting a distributor incentive program to encourage better pump sale tracking. And of course I’ll be strutting around like it’s nobody’s business with a gangsta’ roll of Malawian Kwacha. Wish me luck.&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cE6WaVY2lBo/TiFU9NyrMiI/AAAAAAAAAzA/KF0wy1BuaDQ/s1600/Pictures+224.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cE6WaVY2lBo/TiFU9NyrMiI/AAAAAAAAAzA/KF0wy1BuaDQ/s320/Pictures+224.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
