Thanks for the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-dumarslebron110308&prov=yhoo&type=lgns">link</a>, Doug. This sounds like a pretty legitimate argument; especially when a rival GM says, "Damn it, I am afraid Joe has this whole thing wired. Heâ€™s got everything in place to pull this off."<br /><br />When will the Lions wise up and hire Duuuuuuumars as their GM?<br /><br>
