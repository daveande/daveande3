<br>Brian Emeott sent me this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/19/business/businessspecial2/19generations.html?emc=eta1">article</a> in the New York Times.  This decline has been playing out in Flint for all of my life, but it looks like every thing is finally coming to a head.<br /><br /><blockquote>In many ways, it was not the government but Detroit and other major industries, at the prodding of their unions, that created the American-style social safety net, and helped foster the shared prosperity that is now fracturing.</blockquote><br />This article really hit close to home for me.  I've heard a lot of the same feelings expressed in the quotes from my dad.  It's really sad to think of all of the families (including my own and most of my hometown friends' families) that these changes will affect and are already affecting.
