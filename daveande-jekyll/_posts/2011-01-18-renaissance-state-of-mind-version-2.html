Another version of Empire State of Mind Detroit style. This one has some pretty clever lyrics, especially since it was <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110118/FEATURES01/101180352/1318/Detroit-kids-choir-remakes-R&B-hit-for-city-anthem">written by fourth through seventh graders at Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>. My favorite - "We love our city so don't have a pity."<br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/18721540" width="500" height="220" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/18721540">Empire State of Mind: Detroit Style</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1761292">frank collins</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><br />You can find the first one <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2010/01/renaissance-state-of-mind.html">here</a>.<br /><br>
