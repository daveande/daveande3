<br>After reading about <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/movies/30bara.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1133558194-xbsOeehh2WzAIQcsrQmLsA">Boys of Baraka</a> in the New York Times sometime in August, I went and saw it when the movie screened at the Detroit Documentary Film Festival.   I guess it's playing in New York now, but keep an eye out for it in your city because it's well worth seeing.  The girl who made it is from Detroit too!
