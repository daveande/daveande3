<br>On Wednesday morning, the online edition of the the <a href="http://www.freep.com">Detroit Free Press</a> released a new format, making my morning noticeably more exciting and enjoyable (it's sad, I know).  I've enjoyed getting used to it the past couple of days, and as I become more and more comfortable with it, I think I really like it.  It's much better than the last version.  It does, however, look just like a lot of the other online editions of Gannet newspapers.  Compare it to the <a href="http://www.indystar.com">Indianapolis Star</a> or the <a href="http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/">Tuscon Citizen</a>.<br /><br />I still think that the web edition of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> is the best.
