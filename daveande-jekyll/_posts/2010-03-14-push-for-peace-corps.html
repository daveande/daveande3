<a href="http://pushforpeacecorps.org/">Contact your representative now to encourage the signing of a letter urging $465 million for Peace Corps in FY 2011.</a><br /><br />And for those that need to be convinced, I leave it to the authors of my favorite two books about the Peace Corps experience (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Village-Waiting-George-Packer/dp/0374527806/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1268607782&sr=8-1">The Village of Waiting</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Town-Years-Yangtze-P-S/dp/0060855029/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1268607807&sr=1-1">River Town</a>). <a href="http://pushforpeacecorps.org/writer-george-packer-togo-82-83-says-keep-pushing/"><br /><br />George Packer</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Peace Corps provides the best return on the dollar in America’s entire foreign policy budget. The program educates thousands of young Americans in each new generation about the reality of life as lived by most of the world’s population.</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://pushforpeacecorps.org/writer-peter-hessler-china-96-98-says-push/">Peter Hessler:</a><br /><br /><blockquote>I was fortunate to attend Princeton and Oxford universities, but the most important part of my education was the two years I spent in the Peace Corps.  I learned to teach and communicate with people very different from myself, and I learned Chinese — but the most important lesson was one of perspective.  I saw the world differently, and that viewpoint has informed everything I’ve written since.  This is true of many former volunteers in many walks of life:  teachers, organizers, diplomats.  It’s a shame that in a country with such an active foreign policy, relatively little attention and support has been given to the Peace Corps.</blockquote><br /><br>
