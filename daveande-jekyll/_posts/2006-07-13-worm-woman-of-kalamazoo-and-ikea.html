<br>I initially hated IKEA as I first visited when I lived in London and anything in/around/about London I hated.  But, since they built a store within the Metro-Detroit region I've been slowly growing to like the company.  <br /><br />Now, after receiving <a href="http://www.wormwoman.com/acatalog/IKEA-vermicomposting/IKEA-vermicomposing-02.html">this link</a> from a former professor, I think I have to love them.  Commercial scale vermicomposting!  I wonder if Ingvar Kamprad has read <a href="http://www.natcap.org/">Natural Capitalism</a>.
