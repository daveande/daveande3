I enjoyed this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/sports/baseball/a-long-awaited-upswing-for-downtown-detroit.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">short article on downtown Detroit</a>, specifically this thought from George Royce, a bartender at Detroit Beer Company.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Royce acknowledges that Detroit is not for everyone.<br />“The people who live here usually have something going on,” he says. “They’re artistic, they’re handy, they’re self-starters. People who are finicky don’t come to Detroit. There’s a filter at work here. You’ve got to have self-sufficiency.”</blockquote>One reason I really enjoyed living and working in Kenya and going through the Peace Corps was the ability to meet, learn, work and become friends with, etc the very interesting people that those types of opportunities attract. I've found that to be the case in Detroit as well and it's certainly one of the reasons I enjoy living here way more so than some of the well manicured and more well off cities where I've lived in the past. Royce's comment above perfectly captures the person Detroit is attracting and why that might be the case.
