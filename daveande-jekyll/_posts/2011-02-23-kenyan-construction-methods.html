On my way into work I pass several buildings that are under construction. <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2011/02/first-kenyan-field-trip.html">I've mentioned before</a> that the construction sites I've seen in Nairobi always have many more workers than I'm accustomed to seeing on construction sites in the States. For the most part, machines haven't replaced men. Today, I noticed a vertical assembly line of workers passing up rebar to the top floor of this office building. It has to get up there somehow. And I'm no expert, but I think I could come up with no less than 50 OSHA violations.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C_m5Bwsjh94/TWTnNjuu5KI/AAAAAAAAAn0/PrhsPa57GbU/s1600/IMG_0036.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C_m5Bwsjh94/TWTnNjuu5KI/AAAAAAAAAn0/PrhsPa57GbU/s400/IMG_0036.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576836458707084450" /></a>
