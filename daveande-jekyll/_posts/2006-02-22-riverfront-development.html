Over the last month there's been a lot of exciting news about Detroit's <a href="http://www.detroitriverfront.org/">riverfront</a>.  Two of the three former cement silos are now <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060215/BUSINESS04/602150409/1017">slated for redevelopment</a> that will include condos, retail, and restaurants, creating a walkable/liveable community <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/683/1682/1600/east%20riverfront.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/683/1682/320/east%20riverfront.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> along the river.  This announcement comes just a month after GM selected a development firm for property just east of the Ren Cen, and construction is set to begin on the new <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060221/BUSINESS06/602210397">Asian Village development</a> in the same area.  It looks like this neighborhood is well on it's way to taking off and becoming a downtown destination.  I wish it could happen overnight.  <br /><br />Detroit's Super Bowl success, riverfront news, and news that the city leads southeast Michigan in <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060214/NEWS01/602140313">new housing permits</a> should finally give some skeptical suburbanites legitimate reasons to get excited about their city.
