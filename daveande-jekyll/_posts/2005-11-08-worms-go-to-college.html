<br>Brent Carr and I were part of a small group that <a href="http://www.freep.com/features/living/worm8e_20051108.htm">started this pilot program</a> last year.  At the end of the semester we recruited Julie Cotton to maintain the garden and vermicomposting bin, taking over where we left off.  This is great!  Also check out the Free Press' <a href="http://www.freep.com/features/living/worm-bar18e_20051108.htm">guide to vermicomposting</a>.  Saving the world!
