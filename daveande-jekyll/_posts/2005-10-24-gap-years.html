<br>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/education/23careers.html">article</a> about college graduates taking a year or two off after graduation certainly reflects what a lot of people I know have decided to do.  Although I think grad school and certain gap year jobs can shield you from the quick lessons you learn from a more permanent, fulltime job, I definitely see a lot of value in a gap year.  I wonder if this will continue to increase in popularity?
