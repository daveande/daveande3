This is an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/magazine/22Nicaragua-t.html?pagewanted=1">excellent article</a> on recent Nicaraguan history told through the lens of one of the country's most famous families. If you like the article and are interested in learning more about Nicaragua, or are just looking for a good book, I'd suggest Stephen Kinzer's <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Brothers-Stephen-Kinzer/dp/0399135944">Blood of Brothers</a></span>.<br /><br />The only critique I have of the article is when in the second to last paragraph, the author describes the Chamorro neighborhood as "middle-class." I can assure you that anyone in Nicaragua dining on seafood paella and living in a "sprawling four bedroom" is much wealthier than "middle-class," and it's a disservice to the country to describe the neighborhood as such when my friends and the majority of the country struggle to get by on <a href="http://daveande.blogspot.com/2007/04/one-dollar-day.html">less than $2/day</a>.<br /><br>
