<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">My project is unrelated to selling our pumps, but I happened to be in Lusaka during the Zambian agricultural show this past weekend and was happy to lend a hand to my boss, our Zambian sales rep, and our distributors to help present our pumps. I actually wasn't too excited about it at first - there were a lot of things I'd rather do than sit in the hot sun, in the middle of a very large and dusty showgrounds with a carnival like atmosphere and shoulder to shoulder people - but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. My boss and I made up a good team, selling three pumps in one afternoon, and it felt good to do something that seemed so helpful, easily answering farmer questions about the pump and how it works. Of course not so easy at first, but within fifteen minutes I had it down. 4,000 liters of water in one hour, 10 meters of inlet pipe, 25 meters of outlet pipe, 4 spare piston cups, 1 year guarantee, irrigate up to 2 hectares in one day, 5 distributors and several dealers throughout the country. Any readers interested in becoming a small scale farmer?</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZL36WLr4qCI/TjmgM66_wXI/AAAAAAAAAzY/izAc8F3Q6Rs/s1600/IMG_0837.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZL36WLr4qCI/TjmgM66_wXI/AAAAAAAAAzY/izAc8F3Q6Rs/s320/IMG_0837.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--lQdpoQWQcQ/TjmhFSXIhjI/AAAAAAAAAzk/9PbRgJhdE9A/s1600/IMG_0840.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--lQdpoQWQcQ/TjmhFSXIhjI/AAAAAAAAAzk/9PbRgJhdE9A/s320/IMG_0840.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujmSSzgi7fI/TjmhnxSDBxI/AAAAAAAAAzo/AP3UN4liYk8/s1600/IMG_0845.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujmSSzgi7fI/TjmhnxSDBxI/AAAAAAAAAzo/AP3UN4liYk8/s320/IMG_0845.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>
