Looking for a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/alliedfabrication">Detroit themed gift</a>? Look no further. I present you Allied Fabrication System's newest print, the Metro Detroit Map:<br /><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CWAmPWWm6Ds/TgMZIeHWj8I/AAAAAAAAAxI/0ei5UzYDmJI/s1600/Picture7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CWAmPWWm6Ds/TgMZIeHWj8I/AAAAAAAAAxI/0ei5UzYDmJI/s320/Picture7.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><blockquote><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">The word "Detroit" means many things to different people, but we can agree that its definition stretches beyond the borders of the city proper. Featuring the cities and towns that form the Detroit Metro area, the map is our attempt to give each town its separate identity, while sewing them all together into the patchwork quilt that forms the region. Locals from all over the region will be able to find their own cities and towns on the map, and see that each is a unique part of a greater whole. Hand-printed on paper cut to 16" x 20" from French Paper from Niles, Michigan.</span></blockquote><div><br /></div><div>You can find them at a number of stores throughout Metro Detroit or visit their Etsy Shop to buy online (<a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/alliedfabrication">Allied Fabrication Etsy shop</a>).
