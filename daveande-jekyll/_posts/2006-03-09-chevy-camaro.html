I think if the production model looks like the Camaro concept that debuted at the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, GM will have a hit.  My only worry is that it'll take a good two to three years to develop the car and get it into dealer showrooms.  Regardless, retooling the Oshawa plant as a flexible manufacturing facility and saving close to 6,000 workers is good news.
