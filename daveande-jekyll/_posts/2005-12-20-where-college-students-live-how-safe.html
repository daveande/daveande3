<br><a href="http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051220/NEWS05/512200366">Definitely unsafe</a>.  My house on State Street had burning, unattended candles, couches next to a propane tank on the porch, and no fire extinguisher.  When my winter coat caught on fire, we were lucky enough to fill up a pot of water quick enough to put out the growing flames.  We were smart enough to be aware of these obvious hazards, but dumb enough to ignore and laugh at them.  Stupidity.<br /><br />Check out the graphic on the side of the article.  I'm pretty sure we violated at least seven of the eleven tips they have on staying safe.  My favorite was the tenth comment on space heaters.  "Remove unattended space heaters.  And keep things that burn at least three feet away."  Holmes!
