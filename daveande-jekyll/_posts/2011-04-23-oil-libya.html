Forget the gas tax. America could quickly ween itself off of foreign oil if gas stations were named like this chain of stations I've seen in Nairobi.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Tg_bv5wznk/TbMQDoGaz4I/AAAAAAAAAsQ/x2Ks8shdK_E/s1600/IMG_0459.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Tg_bv5wznk/TbMQDoGaz4I/AAAAAAAAAsQ/x2Ks8shdK_E/s400/IMG_0459.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5598836416241651586" /></a><br /><br />Imagine every time you went to the pump you were greeted with a big sign that said "Oil" followed by the origin of the gas. Oil Libya, Oil Venezuela, Oil Iraq. I'd probably think twice. Better yet, we should not only require all gas stations to change their name to state the origin country of the gas but to also include a picture of the country's ruling leader. <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.anorak.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Moammar-Gaddafi.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.anorak.co.uk/270735/politicians/gaddafi-accuses-wikileaks-of-causing-death-in-tunisia.html&usg=__NDTT9yMgd8tSOcUCrUUN0yku3Jg=&h=255&w=300&sz=18&hl=en&start=1&zoom=1&itbs=1&tbnid=MXksupNvhwIIrM:&tbnh=99&tbnw=116&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dgaddafi%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1366%26bih%3D653%26gbv%3D2%26tbm%3Disch&ei=6A6zTZyWI8aY8QPAvq3RAQ">Especially when that ruler looks as crazy as this wax doll.</a><br /><br />Note: After having this idea, I did some googling to see where the US gets its oil. <a href="http://www.consumerenergyreport.com/research/crude-oil/where-the-us-gets-its-oil-from/">Turns out, nearly 20% of our oil comes from Canada and 49% comes from the Western Hemisphere.</a> Oil Canada doesn't sound too menacing, and Stephen Harper looks way too wholesome for this to work. Oil Venezuela might.
